<p>Biography</p>
<p>Hello sir/ma, My name is  Opeyemi Emmanuel Oyelola. I really love solving problems and making things better, whether it's helping people or taking care of our environment. I'm also super excited about computer and electrical engineering, and I really want to figure out how they work, especially when it comes to programming.

    It all started with my love for video games. I had no idea that playing games would lead me to be so fascinated by technology. What used to be just a fun hobby turned into a big interest in learning more.
    
    Sadly i couldn't study computer science  butI'm looking forward to exploring programming more too. Right now, I know a little bit about html and css.
    
    I hope to combine my previous little programming skills with what i will learn here. cheers </p>

    <h2>My goals here at altschool africa</h2>
